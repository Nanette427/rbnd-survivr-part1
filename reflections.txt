How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?

The gem use metaprogrammation in order to generate all the color methods on the fly. To do that we use a hash table, each key of the hash is a symbole representing the color (text) and each value is the color code.


And, the following reflections:

How long did you spend working on this project?
2 hours... But I'm not really happy with my solution! In fact if you want to colorize a string you need to do the following: 

my_string = "my_string"
my_string.blue(my_string)

It's seems pretty stupid to call the method blue on my_string and to pass my_string as an argument.
I will expect to find a solution that allow the user to do" 

my_string.blue

But I'm really stuck for the moment. Will try to find something



What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
It's not a conquest for the moment it's more a dead-end for the moment.

Where do you still have room to grow?
Find a solution !!!
